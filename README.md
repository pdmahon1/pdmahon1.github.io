Hi! 

Welcome to my absolutely simple webpage. Admittedly, I grew tired of filling out applications to hundreds of jobs on my free time and decided to build a webpage instead.

Given the restrictions of publishing through Github.io, I decidede to mix things up a bit and create a single page application (SPA) using pure JavaScript and CSS styling. 

- No libraries. 

- No build tools. 

- Just the basics.


Also, building this page makes me realize I need to finish learning from the Odin Project. Also, I might pursue the Google UI/UX course on Coursera because this page is **basic** and could use some pizzazz.
