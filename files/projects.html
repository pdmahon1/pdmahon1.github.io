        and attempts to comment on the submission so that potential shoppers can make informed

        I claim I have a NAS; it's more like a digital hoarding "problem" that I make conveniently accessible to my devices.
        I <em>would</em> use these scripts to download and archive video files for long term use if the legality of it wasn't so questionable. 
        But hey! At least others can use them as a great starting point.

        I have many video files -- we're talking thousands! -- and I was tired of manually replacing certain unicode characters with characters I wanted in their place. 
        I made it through maybe two dozen files before realizing I was doing this terribly inefficiently. 
        So now I have a Python script to do the work automatically. I could have used GNU's <em>rename</em> program, 
        but (1) I didn't know it existed and (2) it isn't recursive anyway, which is what I needed.
        The README tells you more.

            I grew tired of writing job applications all the time, so I made this for fun. 
            The webpage is a single page application (SPA) that uses pure JavaScript and CSS and is hosted by Github.
            <ul>
                <li>No libraries.</li>
                <li>No build tools.</li>
                <li>Just the basics.</li>

        The owner of the ATV club wanted a website.
        His requirements were simple:
        <ul>
            <li>He wanted a simple design</li>
            <li>He wanted full access and full control of the website, so it had to be easy for him to maintain.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>I created this WordPress website for Mr. Mark Ready over the course of a week after my kid went to bed. That includes a night of cleaning up the logo with amateur GIMP skills. Since then, Mr. Ready has updated the site and added links of his own.<br /></p>
        <p>I know the site is super basic, but that's what he wanted. He was fully aware that I had never used WordPress but was still pleased with the final result.
